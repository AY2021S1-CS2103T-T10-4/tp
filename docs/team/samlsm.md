## Project: Tutor's Pet

Tutor's Pet is a **desktop application for managing students and classes, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Tutor's pet can get your class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
