## Project: Tutor's Pet

Tutor's Pet is a **desktop application for managing students and classes, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Tutor's pet can get your class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Documentation**:
  * About Us :
    * Set up base template AboutUs for team's usage
  * User Guide:
    * Reformatted User Guide and tailored it to Tutor's Pet Project (E.g Changed entries -> students, /t to /tag, Changed tag description, Removed address, etc)
    * Added documentation for `list-students` and `clear-class` related commands
    * Consolidated and organised all commands into a table and also to follow a certain action sequence
  * Developer Guide:
